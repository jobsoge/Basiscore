The following items keep getting updated frequently, even when CMS is refreshed or idle.
This means, the OnItemSaving method in the custom event handler will be triggered.

The logic to exclude the audit logging on those "schedule" items is already handled in code.
However, as an extra measure, you can disable those items (if you are not using them), by setting the end date to any passed date.
